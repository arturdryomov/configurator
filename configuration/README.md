# Configuration

## Dotfiles

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ming13/dotfiles.git
$ cd dotfiles && make install
```

## System

### Automated

The best way is to execute scripts at `system` and `applications` directories manually, because OS X versions tend to change things.

### Manual

* Spotlight. Privacy. Add `~/Code`.
* Keyboard. Input Sources. Add Russian.
* Keyboard. Shortcuts. Change input sources and Spotlight ones.
* Sound. Show volume in menu bar â€” enable.
* Mission Control. Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use: off.
